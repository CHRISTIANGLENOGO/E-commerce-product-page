## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- SCSS
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vanilla JavaScript

### What I learned

I've learned how to change the color of svg. I used to put into the img element until i noticed that it wont change the color when hovering over it. Though it just a small thing but for me it's one of the most important to learn as basic knowledge in html and css. 

### Continued development

In the JavaScript side I still have a lot to learn specifically working on DOM. I often dependent to the others code when creating a structure. Now I spend more time to cultivate and expand more knowledge in JavaScript.

### Useful resources

- [w3school](https://www.w3schools.com/) - This website helped me to understand more of the methods and syntax.
